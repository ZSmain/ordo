# Ordo - Time Tracking App

A simple time tracking application inspired by "Simple Time Tracker" mobile application.

## Features

- üìä Track time spent on various activities
- üìÅ Organize activities into multiple categories
- üéØ Set daily, weekly, and monthly goals
- üìà View detailed statistics and progress
- üîç Search and filter categories when creating/editing activities

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte/SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS & Shadcn-svelte
- **Backend**: SvelteKit remote functions
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (LibSQL) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Better Auth
- **Validation**: Valibot

## Activity Management

- **Multi-Category Support**: Activities can now belong to multiple categories simultaneously
- **Enhanced Category Selection**: When creating or editing activities, you can:
  - Select multiple categories using checkboxes
  - Search through categories with a built-in search filter
  - View selected categories as visual badges
- **Improved User Experience**: Better accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file with:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   # Add other required environment variables for authentication
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
   BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-app-domain

   # Optional tuning for password hashing (defaults work for local dev)
   # Lower the iteration count if Cloudflare Workers report CPU limit errors
   PASSWORD_HASH_ITERATIONS=60000
   PASSWORD_HASH_KEY_LENGTH=32
   PASSWORD_HASH_SALT_LENGTH=16
   ```

   When deploying to Cloudflare Pages + D1, keep the iteration count between
   40,000 and 80,000 to stay under the worker CPU budget while maintaining
   strong hashing. Increase gradually if you observe low CPU usage.

3. **Apply the database schema:**

   ```sh
   pnpm run db:migrate
   ```

   This runs every migration in `drizzle/` against your local SQLite file
   (the default `.env` points `DATABASE_URL` to `file:local.db`). Avoid using
   `pnpm db:push` once migrations exist‚Äîit can drift the schema away from the
   recorded migration history and break subsequent deploys.

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Database Commands

- `pnpm run db:migrate` - Run pending migrations (local SQLite by default)
- `pnpm run db:generate` - Generate migration files
- `pnpm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio

### Cloudflare D1 notes

- Local development with `pnpm dev` reads `DATABASE_URL` and therefore uses the
   `local.db` file in the project root.
- When you run `pnpm run preview` (or `wrangler pages dev`), Wrangler spins up a
   Miniflare D1 database under
   `.wrangler/state/v3/d1/miniflare-D1DatabaseObject/*.sqlite`. Apply migrations
   to that instance with:

   ```sh
   pnpm dlx wrangler d1 migrations apply ordo_db --local
   ```

   Replace `--local` with `--remote` when targeting your production D1 database.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with:

```sh
pnpm run preview
```
